    const managementAdviceMap = {
        "Self-direction Thought": "An employee who scores high on 'Self-direction Thought' highly values the freedom to form their own opinions and ideas. As a manager, it is crucial not to micromanage this person, but to provide intellectual space for independent analysis and reflection. Involve them in brainstorming sessions and specifically ask for their unique perspective on complex problems, as they will thrive in this. Avoid imposing rigid thought patterns or presenting decisions as unchangeable facts without sharing the underlying reasoning. By respecting and stimulating their intellectual autonomy, you will not only increase their motivation but also benefit from innovative and well-thought-out insights.",
        "Self-direction Action": "This employee is driven by the freedom to act independently and make their own decisions about how to approach their work. Your role as a manager is to outline clear frameworks and end goals, but then trust that the employee can determine the best path to the result themselves. Delegate responsibilities rather than just tasks, and be open to methods and processes that deviate from the standard, as long as the goal is achieved. Too much control or detailed instructions will be perceived as demotivating and restrictive, which can undermine their proactivity. Give this employee control over their own projects and you will see a highly engaged and responsible professional emerge who shows ownership.",
        "Stimulation": "A high score on 'Stimulation' indicates an employee who gets energy from excitement, novelty, and variety in their tasks. As a manager, you can best motivate this person by involving them in dynamic projects, innovative pilots, or tasks that require a fresh perspective. Routine, repetitive work will quickly lead to boredom and a drop in productivity. Regularly offer new challenges and provide opportunities to learn new skills or work on different projects. By creating a stimulating and varied work environment, you will keep this employee sharp, engaged, and enthusiastic about their contribution.",
        "Hedonism": "This person values pleasure, enjoyment, and an overall pleasant feeling, also in the workplace. As a manager, you can respond to this by ensuring a positive and pleasant work atmosphere where successes are celebrated. Think about organizing informal team activities, acknowledging the importance of a good work-life balance, and creating a comfortable physical workspace. This is not about avoiding work, but about the conviction that work and pleasure can go hand in hand, which benefits overall satisfaction and creativity. By paying attention to the atmosphere and well-being, you ensure that this employee performs their tasks with more energy and a more positive attitude.",
        "Achievement": "This employee is highly motivated by achieving personal success and demonstrating competence. As a manager, it is essential to set clear and challenging, yet achievable goals, so that performance is measurable. Provide regular constructive feedback and, more importantly, explicit recognition for successes achieved and skills demonstrated. Offer plenty of opportunities for professional development and training to further sharpen their competencies. By recognizing and nurturing their drive for achievement, you create a loyal and hardworking employee who strives for excellence.",
        "Power Dominance": "A high score on 'Power Dominance' indicates a desire to exert influence and control over people and processes. As a manager, you can channel this drive positively by giving them responsibility and (informal) leadership within projects. Involve this employee in decision-making processes and give them the opportunity to guide or coordinate others. It is important to steer this towards constructive leadership rather than pure dominance, by focusing on achieving team goals. Give them the authority to make decisions within a defined domain; this way you utilize their natural drive for influence for the benefit of the organization.",
        "Power Resources": "This employee is motivated by gaining control over material and social resources, such as budgets, technology, or status. As a manager, you can motivate them by giving them responsibility over important resources and rewarding their performance with tangible incentives. This could include bonuses, a company car, or the latest technological tools that enhance their status and effectiveness. Make the link between their performance and access to more resources very clear. By giving them control over resources that are essential for the team's success, they will feel valued and powerful.",
        "Face": "For this employee, protecting their public image and avoiding shame or humiliation is of the utmost importance. Therefore, always give compliments and recognition for their work in public, for example, during a team meeting. On the other hand, deliver criticism or constructive feedback always in a one-on-one conversation, in a discreet and respectful manner. Be aware that public criticism can deeply affect them and seriously damage their motivation. By protecting their reputation and treating them with respect, you build a relationship of trust and they will feel safe to take risks.",
        "Security Personal": "This employee highly values a safe, stable, and predictable work environment. As a manager, you can respond to this by ensuring clear communication, clear expectations, and transparency about the company's future. Avoid sudden, unexpected changes, and if they are unavoidable, communicate timely and clearly about the reasons and the process. Job security and a focus on health and safety in the workplace are crucial for them. A structured approach with clear procedures and routines will give them a sense of control and peace, allowing them to perform optimally.",
        "Security Societal": "For this person, not only personal but also societal stability and security are important. They thrive in an organization that exudes order, stability, and a clear structure. As a manager, emphasize the solidity of the company and how the organization contributes to a stable society. Communicate about the long-term vision and the measures being taken to ensure continuity. This employee will be committed to a safe and orderly work environment and to adhering to company rules; show that the organization is a reliable factor.",
        "Conformity-Rules": "This employee finds it important to comply with rules, laws, and formal obligations.
